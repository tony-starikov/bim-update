                            Scan to BIM (Building Information Modeling) service is a process of capturing accurate and detailed measurements of an existing building or structure through 3D laser scanning technology. The scanned data is then used to create a digital representation of the building in BIM software. This process helps create a comprehensive and detailed building model, which can be used for renovation, restoration, or retrofitting purposes. The BIM modeling service is essential in creating a collaborative environment for developing and executing efficient construction projects.

                            The Scan to BIM service offers several benefits over traditional methods of surveying, which include time and cost savings of 28%, greater accuracy, and reduced risk of errors by 40%. It helps minimize on-site work and disruptions reduces the chances of rework, and allows for better visualization and analysis of the building's structure. Additionally, the 3D BIM models enable stakeholders to identify potential issues and conflicts early in the project lifecycle, leading to more effective decision-making and problem-solving.
