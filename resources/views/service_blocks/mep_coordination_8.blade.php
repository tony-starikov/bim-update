                    MEP fabrication is the process of creating detailed shop drawings and models for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems in construction. It ensures precise installation and coordination of MEP components, improving efficiency and quality.

                <p class="h5 fw-normal mt-4" style="text-align: justify;">
                    During MEP fabrication, the design and engineering data from the building's MEP design are translated into highly accurate fabrication-level models and drawings. These models and drawings contain specific details, dimensions, and installation information needed for manufacturing the components and installing the MEP systems on-site.
