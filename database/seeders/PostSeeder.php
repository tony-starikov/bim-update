This quick guide provides insight into what BIM is, how it&nbsp;</span><span lang="ru-UA">works, and why it is important to manufacturers and designers alike.<br><br></span></p><h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span lang="ru-UA">THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION IS IN THE MAKING</span></strong></span></h2><p><span lang="ru-UA"><br></span><span lang="ru-UA">BIM began more than a decade ago, and today there are millions of active BIM users around the world. But what led to the upgrade of traditional drawings to BIM technology? </span><span lang="ru-UA">In the 1980s, construction design moved from manual drafting to computer-aided design - CAD. The popularization of computers made it easier to manage drawings and improved the visualization process. However, these drawings were still predominantly visual representations, making it difficult to collaborate and share information about the construction project. BIM technology solved this problem and began the information age in the construction industry.<br><br></span></p><h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span lang="ru-UA">BIM IN CONSTRUCTION</span></strong></span></h2><p><span lang="ru-UA"><br>BIM technology tools are used to create a complete, finished 3D model of a building using programs such as Revit (Autodesk), MicroStation (Bentley), Graphisoft Archicad, Allplan and Vectorworks (Nemetschek Group). </span><span lang="ru-UA">BIM involves more than just modeling and visualization. It is a procedure that creates a common data model that is available to all project stakeholders, from building designers to construction firms and, ultimately, property owners and managers. These models can also include detailed information about a building\'s life cycle and maintenance needs. Including information such as time planning (4D), cost estimates (5D), and sustainability (6D) gives BIM models additional dimensions.<br><br></span></p><h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span lang="ru-UA">BIM CONTENT</span></strong></span></h2><p><span lang="ru-UA"><br>There is a growing demand for manufacturer-specific BIM content that includes not only the physical properties of products but also important data such as product information, installation instructions, energy consumption, environmental labels, operating costs, and product life cycle.<br><br></span></p><p><span lang="ru-UA">The need for manufacturer-specific BIM content is constantly growing. This content covers not only the physical properties of products but also important data such as installation instructions, product information, energy consumption, environmental labels, operating costs, and product life cycle.</span></p><p><span lang="ru-UA"><br>We should also note the progress in laser scanning and point cloud modeling, a technology that makes it possible to create a digital model of almost any scanned object.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="ru-UA">At "BIMprove LLC", we leverage the power of BIM technology to provide services in this area. </span><span lang="ru-UA"><a href="https://bim-prove.com/#services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can see all of our services on this page.</a></span></p>',

You need to create worksets for users and make sure that everyone works in their own set. To prevent the displacement of the cloud points from the initial coordinates, it is necessary to delete the cloud each time before synchronization with the central model, and then reload it again.<br>BIM 360 account. Each user has his own profile, so there is no need to create worksets. There is also no need to unload the cloud before synchronization.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">BEGINNING OF WORK</span></strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Work on the point cloud in Revit takes place in certain templates. In most cases, the customer provides a template already configured for a specific 9oint cloud. In such a template, the MEP systems are already configured, and all the necessary sizes of architectural and structural elements.<br>In all cases, except as agreed with the customer, it is recommended to load the cloud into the project at common coordinates (Auto &gt; By Shared Coordinates). Next, you need to divide the model into levels, if they were not in the the project.<br><br>Before you start working in the Revit model, you need to perform the following actions:</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Go to the "Manage Links" window and check the location of the point cloud on your computer;</li><li>Check your workset or profile, if using Bima 60;</li><li>Make sure that the cloud is pinned (Pin) and has the "Existing" stage;</li><li>Disable movement of pinned and linked objects;</li><li>Create new views and sections for work by copying existing ones but adding your initials.<br><br></li></ul><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">A FEW TIPS TO SIMPLIFY YOUR WORK</span></strong></h2><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li>It is better to work with two monitors so that 2 previously created sections can be displayed on a second monitor. This makes it possible to better control the position of the elements.</li><li>On the quick access tab, you need to add buttons responsible for turning on and off the point cloud on a particular view and also a button to switch the cloud to the Normal visibility mode for a particular view.</li><li>Hot keys, which can be added to your needs, and your modeling style.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">SEQUENCE OF MODELING IN REVIT</span></strong></h2><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>First of all, modeling of elements that are attached to the roof or floor (walls, columns). In turn, walls should not intersect with each other and other elements, &nbsp;for this there is a tool "Join/Unjoin";</li><li>Columns often serve as loadbearing structures, so they are created using the "Structural column" tool;</li><li>The floor is made with the "Floors" tool, sketching along the outer borders of the walls. After that, using the "Attach Top/Base" tool, align the walls, and columns with the floor, so that when changing the floor, the walls/columns move with it;</li><li>We make the slab along the inner boundaries of the walls. It is necessary to take into account all existing slopes. Interfloor floors must be leveled on the inner surface relative to the cloud points, and mezzanine floors on the lower surface.</li><li>Stained glass is modeled taking into account the panels on the point cloud, you also need to use the profile of the required section;</li><li>Door s/Windows must be made as accurately as possible in width and height of the opening;</li><li>When modeling beams, you must start with the main beams, &nbsp;and then move on to the beam\'s flooring. You also need to pay attention to the material of &nbsp;the &nbsp;beams, because it depends on docking with columns;</li><li>Stairs are modeled with a special tool, the number of steps must coincide with their number in the cloud;</li><li>The railing also has its own tool. The top of the handrail must coincide with the cloud, also Depending on the LOD, it is necessary to observe the coincidence &nbsp;of &nbsp;vertical elements on the Point cloud;</li><li>All elements that can be attached to a separate level should be attached (columns, walls, etc.);</li><li>It is better to make the ceiling separately for each room if another option is not agreed upon with the customer;</li><li>The roof is made in one piece, after which the walls/columns are attached to it using the "Attach Top/Base" tool. After that, the roof is aligned with the point cloud;</li><li>When all this is done, you can model the internal elements of the model.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">DETAILING &nbsp;WHEN &nbsp;MODELING &nbsp;IN REVIT</span></strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">When ordering a project, the customer always specifies the level of development of the information model LOD. LOD (Level of Detail) in BIM is a standard that defines the requirements for 3D geometry. Sometimes customers have their own internal standard of detailing that they must provide.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4 levels of LOD:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">LOD 100 - model in the form of volumetric forming elements with approximate dimensions and shape.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">LOD 200 - the model is presented as an object, more like a building, with approximate size and shape.

Its advantages are undeniable. But for its effective implementation and application, it is necessary to understand the main aspects. One of the standards that can be always heard when implementing a BIM project is LOD. This is what we want to talk about today. What it is, what are the levels of detail, and why do you need to be well-versed in them?</p><p dir="ltr">LOD (Level of Detail) is a standard that defines the 3D geometry requirements that must be achieved. But, in addition to 3D visualization, this also includes filling each element with information. This is one of the foundations of BIM, and anyone related to the project must have the opportunity to obtain the necessary information about any element.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 id="test" dir="ltr">Advantages of LOD</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This standard facilitates communication between AEC industry professionals and modeling experts by using it to determine the level of completion and detail of each element in a design. This process is designed to increase the level of communication and understanding of a project between architects, engineers, contractors, project managers, and owners.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to communication, when choosing the LOD level, all specialists understand what to expect and how much needs to be implemented. This makes it possible to make forecasts and plan the volume of work. Depending on the stage of construction, the level of detail may change.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIMprove</a> team has a lot of experience, so we do know that you should not use LOD 500 during the initial stage, as it doesn&rsquo;t make sense and will only cause a big waste of budget. In other cases, such as after scanning a building, LOD 350 may be required to complete the picture. This choice will be logical and will bring much more benefit. But it all depends on the conditions of the project and the further use of the model.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><div style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>If you need a modeling service, our consultants will promptly help you. <a href="/scan-to-bim-estimates-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Use our Estimates form</a> and receive your results within one working day.</em></div></blockquote><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Where was it formed?</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The concept of LOD was first formed by the American Institute of Architects (AIA), the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI), which represents more than 8,000 construction industry professionals, and the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), in the US. They collectively produced and developed the structural standard that is used now to define the level of detail and information in a BIM model throughout the various stages of a construction project.</p><p dir="ltr">This document was not the very first mention of LOD in the broader sense, but this standard specifically played a key role in establishing a widely known framework for LOD.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">What are the LOD levels?</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">BIM&rsquo;s Level of Detail (LOD) serves as a standard, defining 3D geometry requirements for different projects and needs. Starting with a very basic representation at LOD 100, it&rsquo;s growing to as-built elements at LOD 500. LOD plays a crucial role in enhancing productive communication and helping with a faster decision-making process by specifying information at various stages of a construction project.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BIM LOD 100.</strong> &nbsp;The LOD100 model is used to depict a large area, that only has the total volume of the building. Designing walls, floors, and roofs in Revit or managing the LOD in ArchiCAD would be sufficient and would take a little time for one building. This LOD type is quite conceptual, as it is often used in early design stages.</p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Important aspects:</span></p><ul><li style="list-style-type: none; font-size: 12pt;"><ul><li dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;" role="presentation"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Length</span></li><li dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;" role="presentation"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Width</span></li><li dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;" role="presentation"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Height</span></li><li dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;" role="presentation"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Volume</span></li><li dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;" role="presentation"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Area</span></li></ul></li></ul><p><img src="/images/photos/1/100.png" alt="" width="700" height="394"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BIM LOD 200.</strong> The LOD200 model is often called &ldquo;an approximate geometry&rdquo;.

As an industrial standard, LOD enables architects, engineers, and many other specialists to communicate clearly about the information authenticity tied to model elements, easier, faster and more efficient project implementation. Additionally, LOD serves as a course of required service level, with less work needed for a basic LOD 100 model compared to a more precise LOD 300 model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">LOD is a language for all interested parties working with a BIM project.

In this article, we shall talk about how to model MEP systems on Point Cloud in Revit.</p><p dir="ltr">We won&rsquo;t talk about modeling tools, as you already know them. Specialists of&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIMPROVE&nbsp;</a>company have a lot of experience and will share it with you and tell you about the features of Point Cloud modeling.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Let&rsquo;s start with the fact that MEP systems have a big and important meaning in any facility. They will cover a wide spectrum of directions, like electricity, pipes, air ducts, and others. And each has its details, and nuances, and requires special attention and experience.</p><p dir="ltr">But, unlike modeling on drawings, the modeling on Point Cloud could be smoother. In most situations, sagging and lopsided pipes and other elements will lose their characteristics over time, creating difficulties in modeling on Point Cloud.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Types of engineering systems</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Before we move forward to the general logic of engineering system modeling on Point Cloud, let us briefly talk about each system.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the types of engineering systems: heating, gas supply, electricity, sewage system, water supply, ventilation, and air conditioning. Systems may be connected into a group with a similar modeling principle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Elements with a round cross-section</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This includes a heating system, gas supply, electricity, sewage system, and water supply. It is important to correctly choose a system type, for its purpose determination. The difference between them lies in the fitting and armatures, as each system has its requirements and, accordingly, rotation angles, radius, joints, types of purpose, etc. Often, if fittings are not standard, we recommend creating a new Family, or, if it was discussed with the client, we do a &ldquo;Model-in-Place&rdquo;, keeping in mind the Family converter. There is a perfect<a href="https://apps.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Detail/Index?id=7674884213406283426&amp;appLang=en&amp;os=Win64" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Revit add-in, developed by our BIMPROVE team</a>, for cases like this, so you will be able to convert a model in the same context into the Family in just a few clicks.</p><p dir="ltr">It is necessary to separately highlight the electrical system since it has an additional tray of cables, that are different in their modeling principles and are a bit similar to modeling systems with a square cross-section.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Elements with a square, and rectangular cross-section</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This includes ventilation and air conditioning systems. Similar to systems with a round cross-section, there is a diversity of different fitting types. It is not uncommon to create new Families. Therefore, be prepared for such a scenario.</p><p dir="ltr">Separately, we want to draw your attention to the equipment. Every system has its own. They are both standard and custom ones. We won&rsquo;t pay attention to the standard ones, since most of you know them well; let&rsquo;s just say that while modeling on Point Cloud, it is often necessary to use a &ldquo;Model-in-Place&rdquo; tool.</p><p dir="ltr">Special attention should be paid to the complex equipment. Motors, machines, pumps, and other more complex equipment, need to be modeled using &ldquo;Model-in-Place&rdquo; and then transitioned into Families. The importance is in the diverse complexity of every equipment, and the need to understand that its modeling will take a lot of time. You need to be ready for this since it&rsquo;s pretty rare when even the same facility has a lot of the same equipment type. Even if that<a href="/post/what-is-lod-level-of-detail-in-bim" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> level of detail is LOD100</a>, it still requires the modeler&rsquo;s time and attention.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">General modeling logic MEP system</h2><p dir="ltr">Smoothly coming to a general modeling logic, the most important thing, that needs our attention, is to discuss requirements and tasks with the customer. What is the project&rsquo;s LOD, what are we modeling, the admissibility of intersections, etc.? It is important to clarify all these questions so that it will be easier for modelers and then the customer does not have additional questions.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you get a general understanding of what you need to model and how - we proceed directly to modeling.&nbsp;</p><ol><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">At the very beginning, we choose a starting point for ourselves. It&rsquo;s better if it&rsquo;s any sort of equipment, you can make by Model in Place, and start diverting pipes/air ducts/conduits from it.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Once you&rsquo;ve started routed pipes/air ducts/conduits, it is necessary to create them till the moment when pipes/air ducts/conduits disappear on a Cloud, get to the deadlock, or end up in different equipment.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is necessary to immediately install all the fittings along the route of a given pipe/air duct/conduit, since you can miss or forget it later. We try to select/set the geometric characteristic of the existing Families armature, and if there are no more suitable ones, then you can make it with the &ldquo;Model-in-Place&rdquo; help, and afterward MUST transit it into the Family (a family is made in a specific category, like Pipe Accessory, Duct Accessory, etc.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If it&rsquo;s possible to identify the system that this pipe/air duct/conduit belongs to, and if there are requirements from a customer, then you need to choose a system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If an air duct/pipe comes to any object, for example to the Air Terminal or Sprinkler, then you need to put it right away, so you won&rsquo;t forget or lose it later.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is necessary to use standard fitting Families when modeling insulated pipes.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Pipes and air ducts are usually modeled on an outer insulation size, except when a customer provides drawings, that have pipes and air duct dimensions without insulation.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Pipes and power cables smaller than 50 mm (2 inches) in diameter are not modeled, except in cases when they are combined into routes of 3 or more pipes.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">During the fire suppression system modeling, it&rsquo;s necessary to model all the pipes and sprinklers with no exceptions, even if their diameter is less than 50 mm (2 inches).&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If a pipe/air duct/conduit sags or is not the same as a Cloud for other reasons, it&rsquo;s necessary to correct its geometry using available methods. In cases when it is not possible, you divide it into parts using a Split tool and customize it to the Cloud. With this tool, a system remains complete and does not break off, which is very good when the customer has a task like this.</p></li></ol></li></ol><h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2><p dir="ltr">Modeling engineering systems on Point Cloud presents unique challenges, particularly concerning elements with round, square, and rectangular cross-sections.

These are the rules and principles that we observe and honor.</p><p dir="ltr">But also without a clear understanding of the execution algorithm, it is very difficult to organize the process, especially when many modelers are working on one project.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Opening of access to the project</h2><p dir="ltr">Our company rules and experienced team leads set up the entire organizational process before opening access to the project. This includes assigning someone responsible for the project, describing the project, creating tasks for each modeler in their areas of responsibility, etc. It is important to approach the issue responsibly and carefully because if mistakes are made when part of the project has already been done, they will be more difficult to correct.</p><p><strong><img src="/images/photos/1/ORGANIZING TEAMWORK IN BIM.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1500"><br></strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Communication with the client</h2><p dir="ltr">Next, we will talk about each point separately, but remember, even before describing the project to the team, it is necessary to establish a clear, understandable system of communication with the client. When to call, when to report, etc. Again, our company has built a communication system so that we are with the client almost 24/7. This is important, especially when there is a big difference in time zones. And the client is calmer.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">The main points in organizing teamwork</h2><p><strong><img src="/images/photos/1/2811145 copy.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1920"><br></strong></p><ol><li dir="ltr"><p><strong>Availability of necessary information for all project participants.</strong><br>A separate chat is created for each project. We write all the information there and pin this message, it is also a good idea to write it on the project control panel or in a PDF file. We have developed our special template for the PDF file. It is important that this information can be easily found by everyone involved in the project. This helps avoid asking the same questions.<strong><br><br></strong></p></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Meeting before the start of the project.&nbsp;</strong><br>Before the team starts work, there is a mandatory call with the entire project team. On it, the team lead tells general information, deadlines, and especially the wishes of the customer. Modelers ask questions and get answers. This meeting puts a lot of things into their place, and it makes it much easier to move on.<br><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Structuring all incoming data.&nbsp;</strong><br>All incoming data is always stored in folders that correspond to its format. But for a better understanding of the folder structure, we always explain it in our meetings or our company documentation for our employees.<br><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Easy communication.&nbsp;</strong><br>We have tight deadlines for most of our projects, so we need to solve problems quickly. Sometimes modelers have questions during modeling, so our team lead is always in touch with customers and tries to answer quickly.&nbsp;Also, when we work in the central model on our local server, Revit server, or through BIM360, we have problems with borrowed elements and our project chat helps us a lot, because we can write there about this problem even if we don&rsquo;t know who exactly this user is. Chat like that one helps us to see all the problems and all the communication of all project participants.<br><br></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Accurate completion of assigned tasks on time.&nbsp;</strong><br>To meet project deadlines, it is very important to complete all parts of the project according to its schedule. When we start working on a new project, we divide it into separate parts and assign deadlines to each of those parts.&nbsp;This helps us see when we are running late and add more people to the project to meet the finishing line.<br><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Compliance with all requirements and rules.&nbsp;</strong><br>How to avoid getting a lot of comments from clients? Get everything right from the start! This is the main slogan of our team when implementing the project. We do a daily review of the model and check all completed zones throughout the entire project modeling process. Our modelers also strive to get their work correct from the beginning. This greatly speeds up the final review and number of rework.&nbsp;<br>Our <a href="/service/scan-to-bim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scan to BIM Modeling team</a> is skilled in producing accurate 3D BIM models or 2D drawings for purposes such as design validation, planning, comparison, interference checks, MEP or construction elements demolition or addition, and documentation of existing building conditions.<br><br></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pleasant, working atmosphere in the team.&nbsp;</strong><br>Few people pay attention to this, but when the team is full in the right atmosphere, the work progresses much better and is of higher quality. In our team, in addition to a good, correct attitude, each team member will come to the rescue of a colleague. It also affects engagement. Amazing results are always obtained when everyone is 100% involved in a project.&nbsp;The top priorities of our <a href="/">BIMPROVE </a>team are quality, accuracy, and logic.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>If the team works remotely.&nbsp;</strong><br>Our team works remotely. But if the workflow is properly configured on all the points listed above, it does not matter whether you sit in the same office or each of you stay at their home. The work is done efficiently and quickly.</li></ol><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Effective teamwork in BIM projects requires flawless organization and clear communication channels. From establishing project protocols and communication systems with clients to structuring data and ensuring that tasks will be completed on time, each step plays a vital role in project success.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">By prioritizing accessibility to information, maintaining open connections, and growing a positive team atmosphere, projects can be finished efficiently regardless of remote work setups.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">We have shared with you our organizational issues that are important to follow when working on projects as a team. We hope they will be useful to you if you have not yet organized this process.</p><p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-91a13c78-7fff-d4d8-eb79-076f65ad9081"><br><br><br><br><br></strong></p>',

While some aspects of life have stayed the same, innovation has accelerated, reshaping industries and the daily lives of citizens all over the planet.</p><p dir="ltr">BIM significantly impacted the construction industry by enhancing collaboration, improving design and visualization, increasing efficiency, reducing costs, and supporting sustainable practices. Keeping in mind these points, we have to mention the impact that Scan to BIM technology makes in modern construction projects, since it quickly became an excellent tool for transforming workflows we used to have with the unique Point Clouds.&nbsp; Let\'s learn about Point Cloud and how its existence eases the way modern engineering and construction work.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">So what is Point Cloud?</h2><p dir="ltr">A Point Cloud concept lies in a collection of data points in a three-dimensional coordinate system. This collection is usually generated by 3D scanners, photogrammetry, or LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), and is used in 3D modeling. Each point in the cloud has a specific location defined by X, Y, and Z coordinates.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, Point Clouds may also carry additional information such as color (RGB values) or intensity, which helps render or analyze the data more accurately. For example, a PTX file format includes red, green, and blue components, which helps in generating colorful 3D models out of Point Cloud.</p><p dir="ltr">The density and distribution of points determine the level of detail (LOD). The higher point leads to better detail representation, capturing intricate features of the object or scene. The standards differ from one organization to another, and the final choice of the LOD model usually depends on the client\'s requirements. <a href="/post/what-is-lod-level-of-detail-in-bim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check our article &ldquo;What is LOD (Level of detail) in BIM&nbsp;to learn more about this topic.</a>&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">How can we generate a Point Cloud?</h2><p dir="ltr">Point Clouds are generated using various methods with different technologies and applications. Some of the primary methods are LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and Photogrammetry. The highest accuracy comes with the scanned version. Professionals in this field usually go through a lot of hard training to collect a proper amount of data with the right scanning procedure.</p><p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>LiDAR (Light detection and ranging)</strong></p><p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;">LiDAR technology helps to measure the distance to a target through laser pulses, which will be caught by special sensors, and will later help to calculate the distance through the time it takes for the pulse to come back. The sensor\'s position and orientation eventually help to calculate the precise location of each point, and we&rsquo;re talking not about one, or thousands, but millions of such points, that will be collected into a Point Cloud.</p><p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Photogrammetry</strong></p><p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;">To create a Point Cloud with photogrammetry, specialists take many photographs that differ in angles and process them with specific software into a 3D model or Point Cloud. With the help of useful algorithms, the same points are defined in those pictures, with a variety of angles.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">In comparison, LiDAR laser scanning has an increased accuracy, compared to photogrammetry.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">What are the formats in which Point Clouds are created?</h2><p dir="ltr">The final format of the choice for the Point Cloud usually depends on the ways it was captured and on the software companies used to create it. Since it&rsquo;s more a question of choice, the final step in this conversation goes to the modelers, who pick a program depending on their own preferences and the capabilities of the software. In general .PTG, .E57, .RCS or .RCP formats are the most popular ones.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Processing and analysis of Point Clouds</h2><p dir="ltr">And now we come to the importance of the software BIM modelers choose to work with Point Clouds. Since the process involves handling large sets of data, a Scan To BIM team needs trusted software to model and to move successfully further in the project. There are several BIM software options available. Popular choices include Autodesk Revit, Navisworks, and Autodesk AutoCAD.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">Software for Point Cloud</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Autodesk Revit</strong> is the first software that comes to the mind of VDC specialists due to its modeling capabilities and how well and harmonized it takes and transforms Point Cloud formats, making it the most utilized software for Point Cloud to BIM services.<br><br></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Navisworks </strong>is a software that perfectly works in the field of project review and helps to coordinate and collaborate on BIM projects.

                'content' => '<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">In this article, we will explain what Families in Revit are and their signification in creating 3D models. Revit cannot function without families because they form a library of elements that allow us to recreate real objects in the digital world. There are thousands, even tens of thousands, of Revit families worldwide, and any modeler can create his own families to add to a project and fill with necessary information. This is why Revit is the number one tool in the world of BIM, and we at&nbsp;<a href="/">BIMPROVE </a>enjoy being part of that process.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What are the Families?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Families in Revit are digital counterparts of physical building elements (doors, columns, walls, pipes, engineering equipment, and other elements). A BIM model, being a digital twin of a real construction object, consists of a collection of families assembled according to specific rules. These components, often referred to as "families," may include everything from simple objects like doors and windows to complex assemblies like mechanical equipment or entire room layouts.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>&nbsp;Types of Families</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Let&rsquo;s delve a bit deeper and examine the commonly recognized types of families. There are three types:</p><ol><li dir="ltr"><strong>System Families:</strong> These create core building elements such as walls, roofs, ceilings, floors, and other elements assembled on-site. They are not loaded into projects from external files and are not saved in folders outside the project.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Loadable Families</strong>: These are used to create both building components and some annotation elements. Typically, loadable families create building components that are purchased separately, delivered, and installed in or around the building, such as windows, doors, cabinets, appliances, furniture, and landscaping elements. These families may also include annotation elements that have a standard adaptation procedure, such as labels and title blocks. Loadable families are highly adaptable and are often created in Revit. Unlike system families, loadable families are created in external files (with a .rfa extension) and imported (loaded) into projects.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>In-Place Families: </strong>These are unique elements created to model components specific to a project. They can take any shape, but have some limitations. It might seem convenient to create all components as in-place elements, but this method is recommended only when necessary. In-place elements can increase file size and slow down the program.&nbsp;<br><br>Since we work a lot with Families, we created a feature-rich plugin for Revit. And it has a very important tool - Geometry Convert. This tool allows you to convert any type of geometry, whether it\'s a family or a Generic (Model In Place), into a regular editable Autodesk Revit family. <a href="https://apps.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Detail/Index?id=7674884213406283426&amp;appLang=en&amp;os=Win64">The plugin can be downloaded for free from the official Autodesk store.&nbsp;</a></li></ol><p dir="ltr">Most elements created in projects belong to system families or loadable families. Loadable families can be combined to create nested and shared families. Custom and user-defined elements are created using in-place families.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Steps to Create Revit Families</strong></h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Understanding the Family Editor: This is the environment where you create and modify families. It involves working with different templates, setting up reference planes, and defining parameters.</li><li dir="ltr">Creating Geometry: Develop both 2D and 3D geometry for your components, ensuring they meet project specifications.</li><li dir="ltr">Assigning Parameters: Set up parameters that control the family&rsquo;s behavior and dimensions. This can include material properties, visibility settings, and more.</li><li dir="ltr">Testing and Validating: Once the family is created, it must be tested within a project to ensure it functions as intended. Adjustments are made as necessary based on this validation process.</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Why Families are Vital for BIM Projects</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">After learning the basics of Revit Families and how to create them, let&rsquo;s move on to the benefits of working with and creating families, and why they are essential for BIM projects.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Customization and Detailing: Users can create custom families or modify existing ones to meet specific project requirements. This includes defining parameters, constraints, and behaviors of the elements to ensure they fit seamlessly into the design and perform as intended.</li><li dir="ltr">Parameter Management: Parameters allow for the dynamic adjustment of family elements. For example, you can create a door family with adjustable width, height, and material properties. Proper management of these parameters is crucial for maintaining flexibility and accuracy in the design.</li><li dir="ltr">Content Libraries: Many firms maintain extensive libraries of Revit families, which can be reused across multiple projects. These libraries often include standardized elements that adhere to company or industry-specific guidelines, ensuring consistency and quality in the modeling process.</li><li dir="ltr">Collaboration and Sharing: Effective content creation involves collaboration among various stakeholders. Sharing custom families and models across teams helps in maintaining a unified approach to design and construction, reducing errors and improving project outcomes.</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Applications of Content Creation</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Revit&rsquo;s content creation capabilities span various disciplines, including architecture, structural engineering, and MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing). For example, MEP engineers can create custom duct systems and plumbing fixtures that seamlessly integrate into their models, enhancing design coordination and on-site installation efficiency.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, more and more large companies are creating models of their products for various uses. Household appliances, electronic devices, and furniture from different manufacturers are increasingly found in 3D and created as Revit models.</p><p dir="ltr">Our team of specialists is happy to help you create families of any complexity and detail level (LOD). We have an independent department and a team with over 5 years of experience. If you need 3D models with the parameters and properties you require, we are delighted to assist you. <a href="/">Visit our Content Creation page</a> or <a href="/contact">submit your request directly</a>.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Content creation in Revit is a fundamental aspect of BIM that enhances the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of building design and construction projects. By leveraging Revit\'s powerful tools and creating custom parametric content, design teams can achieve better coordination, visualization, and overall project outcomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',
