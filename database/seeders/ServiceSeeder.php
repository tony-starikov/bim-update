Scan to BIM service can also help to identify potential clashes or design issues early on, minimizing rework and changes during the construction phase. Overall, scan to BIM service can lead to more efficient and cost-effective project delivery."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "What is Level of detail (LOD)?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Level of Design / Development / Detail (LOD) is the overall state of your information model at a particular point in its design process. This includes not only graphical objects, but also the data associated with the objects. Your model should develop over time from a very coarse design to the record drawings and as-builts. This process has been distilled down into five distinct categories as formalized in the AIA E202 contract document. We create BIM models by the Point Cloud in LODs: 100, 200, 300, 350. Learn more about Level of Detail in our article."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "How long does it take to complete a project?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "The duration of a Scan to BIM modeling depends on several factors such as the complexity of the project, the scope of work, the size of the area to be scanned, and the accuracy required. Typically, a scan to BIM project can take anywhere from a from few days to 1-2 months."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "What results will you get by using our service?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "The deliverables of a Scan to BIM service can vary depending on the requirements of the project. However, some common deliverables include 3D BIM models, 2D drawings, point clouds, clash detection reports, and as-built documentation. These deliverables can be used for various purposes such as construction planning, facility management, and renovation projects."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "What types of projects can 3D modeling be helpful for?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Scan to BIM service can benefit a wide range of projects, including those in the architecture, engineering, and construction industries. Some examples include renovation and retrofit projects, heritage preservation, building information modeling, and plant design and construction."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "Who will benefit from our Point Cloud BIM modeling services?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "With 7 years of BIM modeling experience, our team has extensive knowledge with a variety of clients.
